So... I'm not much of a writing guy, but I was feeling like it, thought I
should try.

Well, its been a little over 4 years now since I found out about programming,
and became almost (or actually) obsessed with it, I just wanted to know everything
about programming, I couldn't help it. I have to confess I was kind of annoying,
everything was so new, I felt like a child, I'd question absolutelly everything!

And, just like that, I decided I would be an kick ass programmer... well, I guess
I found out it wasn't that easy...

I think sometimes I am to hard at myself, every piece of code that I wrote that
wouldn't amaze everybody felt like a failure, I just kept (or keep) asking
myself what could I do that would be really awesome... "C'mon I gotta have
THE idea!!!"

I never thought I was actually a bad programmer, so I got to be missing
something... what did those people do that I wasn't doing?! So I decided to
take a closer look, bought every ticket to every conference that was going to
happen.

First thing that I noticed?! Everybody that was speaking was notable. So... I
gave some talks! It was awesome, but I didn't become a rock star...

So... I noticed people that were speaking were there because they were awesome,
not the other way around. So I started talking to people, actually listening to
them, and, of course (I guess), none of them planned to be awesome, they just
missed something and built what they needed (that some other people happened to
need as well)

Then looked back, I was spending all my time thinking about doind something
amazing, forcing myself into having a brilliant idea, instead of just actually
doing some stuff, any stuff, get the things going... I actually didn't even know
what I wanted to really do, I kept asking: "Will I work with mobile, backend or
fronted?", I worked with all of them so I could reasonable pick one and ended up
even more confused...

So I stopped, took some time, and made a decision: I wanna become a Front end
enginner! A kickass one, of course...

That is it, felt so good, not wondering all the time what to do, what to learn,
getting so lost between all of those tecnologies, talks and all the stuff...

Of course I will keep playing with other languages, otherwise there would be no fun in life!!! Currently I'm playing with Go, if you haven't yet check out [ceos-lang](https://github.com/tadeuzagallo/ceos-lang), the language I've been writing, intrepeted in Go.

Now, I just have to finish all the jobs I still have in all those languages, and
then I can hapilly become a Frontender!

BTW: The title was heavily inspired on this awesome talk from [@dmosher](https://twitter.com/dmosher): [So, You Want to be a Front-End Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lsg84NtJbmI)
